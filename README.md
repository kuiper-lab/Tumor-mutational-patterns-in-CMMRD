# Tumor-mutational-patterns-in-CMMRD

The code in this repository was used to perform analyses and create figures for the manuscript "**Unraveling mutagenic processes influencing the tumor mutational patterns of individuals with Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency**" by *Weijers et al*.

The order in and purpose for which the different scripts were used is described below. A supplementary file containing the mutational matrices used in the analyses is provided, as well as a file containing the conversion between the manuscript IDs and the IDs in the datasets uploaded to EGA.
  
<br />  

**SOMATIC CALLING**
  
For samples sequenced with Twist v1, run:  
```generateMutect2CallingJobs.WGS-WXS.IntersectTwist.sh```  

For all other samples, run:  
```generateMutect2CallingJobs.WGS-WXS.Intersect.sh```  
  
Both are followed by:  
```generateMutect2FilterJobs.WXS.noPASS.Intersect.noMNP.sh```  
  
<br />  

**VCF FILTERING**

For all samples:  
```FilterVCFs.R```  
  
<br />  

**MUTATIONAL SIGNATURES**

First, create the mutational matrices:  
```Create_MutationalMatrices.R```  
  
Extract Mutational Signatures using a combination of:  
```generateDeNovoExtractionJob.sh and denovoextraction.R (SNV)```  
```generateDeNovoExtractionJobIndel.sh and denovoextraction_indel.R (indel)```  
  
Perform further downstream signature analyses using:  
```SignatureAnalysesRefits.R```  
  
<br />  

**SigProfiler**

Create the mutational matrix using SigProfiler:
```Part_I_create_mutational_matrices.R```
```Part_II_Mutational_Matrices.txt```

Signature extraction using SigProfiler:
```Mutational_Signatures.txt```

<br />

**PLOT MANUSCRIPT FIGURES**

```PlottingCMMRDFigures.R```
```MS_contributions.R```  
```Supplemental_Fig5C.R```
  
<br />  

**PERFORM STATISTICS**

```StatisticsCMMRD.R```  
  
<br />  

**SUPPLEMENTARY FILES**

Conversion file manuscript ID to EGA ID: ```NCOMMS-23-52197_Conversion_ManuscriptID_EGA-ID.xlsx```
